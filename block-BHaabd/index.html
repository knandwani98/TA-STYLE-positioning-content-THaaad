                            <p>Inspired by the success of DC Comics’ Justice League of America, which featured characters such as Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman, Marvel sought to unite its biggest names in a single book. The Avengers, however, was anything but a carbon copy of Justice League. Marvel’s team was characterized by internal conflict, and it owed its existence largely to the machinations of a villain. Loki, the Norse god of mischief, maneuvers his half brother, the thunder god Thor, into a battle against the Hulk. This fracas also attracts the attention of Iron Man and the crime-fighting duo of Ant-Man and the Wasp.</p>
                            <p>Although this quartet at first believes the Hulk to be the villain responsible for an act of railway sabotage, Loki quickly emerges as the real culprit and suffers a decisive defeat. Before the heroes disperse, Ant-Man suggests that they make their association a permanent one, and the Avengers (a name suggested by the Wasp) are born.</p>
                            <p class="quote">The team’s lineup changed almost immediately, with the departure of the Hulk and the induction of Captain America, who had been frozen in a block of ice since the end of the World War II.</p>
                            <p>In its next roster shuffle, The Avengers further distinguished itself from Justice League of America by questioning the idea of heroism itself. Whereas the JLA members were all unambiguously heroic, more than a few Avengers started their careers as villains. When Thor, Giant-Man (the former Ant-Man, who would later change his name again to Goliath), and the Wasp simultaneously leave the team, Captain America finds himself heading a new squad of Avengers, each of whom has a checkered past. The bow-wielding Hawkeye previously fought against Iron Man, whereas Quicksilver, a mutant speedster reminiscent of DC’s Flash, and the Scarlet Witch, a young woman with the power to alter probabilities, had been members of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants along with their father, Magneto. The theme of redemption is reinforced when Wonder Man, introduced as a villain in The Avengers no. 9 (October 1964), returns from the dead as a hero and takes his place in the Avengers’ ranks.</p>

                            <p>the Avengers, American comic strip superhero team whose frequently changing roster often included some of the most popular characters in the Marvel Comics universe. Billed as “Earth’s mightiest super-heroes,” the team was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, and it debuted in The Avengers no. 1 (September 1963).</p>
